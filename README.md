# Git-API-info-Etraction-Project
Extracting information about repositories related to popular API's used by developers.
In a service-oriented environment, Web service composition allows dynamic integration of Web
services. The performance of the dedicated services determines the overall performance of the
composed service. Therefore, extracting and analyzing related information about APIs form
developers’ communities such as GitHub will provide valuable information for newly applied
service. We applied sentiment analysis on extracted comments to infer developers’ interests in
APIs through natural language processing. This interest score can be used as a recommendation
for new mashup/composition service.
